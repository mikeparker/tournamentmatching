Next up : UI

After picking players it shouold have:

1. a list of players, playing and their current scores, with their game results so far
2. 

Should we separate the round picking and the scores?

For now, separate the scoring

So all we need to do to is: Pick a round, display teh next round, who's sitting out
- Parameters to post: The list of players
- Things to display from the round:
--- The matches
--- Who is sitting out



ALSO:
- Need to solve the issue that not everyone plays the same number of games. If there are 17 people and 6 rounds then only 6 people will sit out. (is this an issue?)


EVENTUALLY
- Host as website
- Open up for everybody
- Allow clubs to register lists of players
- Perhaps even nationwide / international rankings list
